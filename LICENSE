This project was developed as part of the Oracle Next Education and Alura Latam 
learning program, transforming a basic programming challenge into a professional 
data science application.

The algorithms implemented in this software are based on established mathematical 
and statistical principles:

- Simple Random: Standard pseudo-random number generation
- Fisher-Yates Shuffle: Knuth's modern algorithm for unbiased permutation
- Weighted Random: Statistical inverse frequency weighting for fairness
- Crypto-Secure Random: Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure randomness

Educational Use:
This software is particularly suited for educational purposes in:
- Programming and algorithm development
- Statistics and probability theory
- Data visualization and analysis
- User interface and experience design
- Software testing and quality assurance

Commercial Use:
While this software is free for commercial use under the MIT license, 
attribution to the original author is appreciated but not required.

Contributing:
Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome. Please refer to
